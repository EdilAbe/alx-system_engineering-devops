# System Engineering and DevOps

This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at 'ALX Africa SE'. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Shell, basics]
